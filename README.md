# Hi there üëã I am Nico!

I am all excited about understanding human decision-making, I explore the fascinating world of group dynamics, consensus-building, and the spread of misinformation. My work combines traditional psychology research with cutting-edge tools like AI and online experiments.

Remember, science is all about collaboration! Feel free to explore my repositories, and reach out to me if you are intrigued. üß†üîç

## üî¨ Research Focus

- **Judgment and Decision-Making**: I investigate how individuals make choices under risk and uncertainty -- and in the presence of others.
- **Group Dynamics**: Understanding how groups interact, form opinions, reach consensus, and influence individual behavior.
- **Misinformation**: Tracking the spread of false information online and developing strategies to combat it.

## Current work 

Currently I am working on news reporting during the COVID pandemic and ask how we can develop tools to make the life of journalists easier.

## üöÄ Skills and Tools

- **Languages**: R, Python, Java Script
- **Tools**: RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub Actions, Google Colab
- **LLMs**: ChatGPT and Vertex AI
