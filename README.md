# Hi there 👋 great that you are here!

Welcome to my page!
I am Nico, a psychological scientist who is excited about understanding human decision-making. I am intrigued by the question how the combination of scientific insights and artificial intelligence can help us make better decisions to make our lives easier.

As a scientist, I explore the fascinating world of group dynamics, consensus-building, and the spread of misinformation. My work combines traditional psychology research with cutting-edge tools like AI and online experiments -- maybe I am as exccited about human decision making and learning as I am about the learning of machines.

Currently I am working on news reporting during the COVID pandemic and ask how we can develop tools to make the life of journalists easier. So I finally get to learn more about Machine Learning, Natural Language processing and the perks of Large Language models.


## Research Focus

- **Judgment and Decision-Making**: I investigate how individuals make choices under risk and uncertainty -- and in the presence of others.
- **Group Dynamics**: Understanding how groups interact, form opinions, reach consensus, and influence individual behavior.
- **Misinformation**: Tracking the spread of false information online and developing strategies to combat it.


## Skills and Tools

- **Languages**: R, Python, Java Script
- **Tools**: RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub Actions, Google Colab, ChatGPT and Vertex AI
- **Statistical analyses**: (Bayesian) Hierachical models (aka multi-level mmodels), basic statistics, visualizations


Remember, science is all about collaboration! Feel free to explore my repositories, and reach out to me if you are intrigued. I **LOVE** to help out folks with statistics and modelling and figure out solutions together!
